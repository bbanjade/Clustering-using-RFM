# Clustering-using-RFM

## 1. Clustering of customers based on RFM Segmentation through K-means algorithm

This analysis analyze the online retail sales data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail to understand the possible group of customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary values using K-means clustering.

Library used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and sklearn.

Exploratory data analysis performed to understand the distribution of the data through creation of summary statistics, tables, and charts.

RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary values) is based on their recent purchase behavior, the frequency of their purchases, and the total money spent by each customers.

Elbow method, Flattened graph, and Snake plot used to understand the number of clusters. Four clusters were the optimum number of clusters.


## 2.Mall Customer Cluster Analysis

This analysis analyze the kaggle dataset "Mall Customer Segmentation Data" and presented the understanding of the customers and their purchase behavior. This project is based on visualization and the clustering of customers is presented based on the scatter plot of Spending score (1-100) and Annual Income. 

Library used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, and pyplot.

Visualizations: bar chart, countplot, histogram, scatterplot, and heatmap.
